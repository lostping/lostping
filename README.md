ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lostping!

I'm not a full-fledged developer.
But I am an enthusiast who works on whatever is fun and useful to myself (and probably others).
I really like to learn new stuff (the hard, self-taught way) and sharing my knowledge with other people.
Knowledge must be free and for everyone!

To be honest, **I know my code sucks**. But _somehow_ my stuff works for me and some other people ðŸ˜…

- If my stuff works for you: Cool!
- If my stuff doesn't work for you: Sorry!
- If you have better coding skills: Feel free to create a pull request with fixes and optimizations for any of my projects.

Cheers

LostPing
