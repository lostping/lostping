ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lostping!

I'm not a full-fledged developer.
But I am an enthusiast who works on whatever is fun and useful to myself (and probably others).
I really like to learn new stuff (the hard, self-taught way) and share my knowledge with people like me.
Knowledge must be free and for everyone!

To be honest, I know my code sucks. But somehow my stuff works for me and some other people ðŸ˜…
If my stuff works for you, cool!
If my stuff doesn't work for you, sorry!
If you have better coding skills, feel free to create a pull request with fixes and optimizations.
